"If you keep trying to fill your holes with the next best thing,
Well then, the next best thing will give you more and more holes.
Keep trying to fill your holes with the next best thing,
And the next best thing will give you more and more holes.
You were better as a simple one, simple one.
Yeah, you were better as a simple one, simple one.
So peel your layers off 1x1x1." - Cloud Cult
